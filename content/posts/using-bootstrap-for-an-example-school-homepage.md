So as I plod through The Odin Project - I got through the 101 section and am currently swotting up on javaScript ahead of the full JS section - I thought about how coding could benefit my current work.

We're looking to offer a service to schools whereby we manage their website and content. Part of that may be creating new websites for them because, at least where I'm from, school websites tend to be awful to look at.

For some time I've wanted to know what all the fuss is about with Bootstrap. I know - I'll create a school homepage using Bootstrap... I found a decent tutorial that I was able to adapt to my own purposes - the nav bar, footer, three-column section are Bootstrap code which I changed the styling for.

* Tutorial used: [This one from WebsiteSetup.org](https://websitesetup.org/bootstrap-tutorial-for-beginners/#1).
* Time taken: A few hours
* End result: [Example School homepage](https://canicodenow.github.io/example-school/)

Tricky parts:

* I want to figure out how to get images to default to a certain size, regardless of what I import it as. I fiddled with max-width, min-width and the like, but it messed up the responsiveness.
* Putting links in the titles of the items in the three-column section makes the text too close to the image. I need to look at what element to tweak to  maintain the padding (I think...)

I won't lie; I don't understand fully what Bootstrap has to offer, nor do I know how to take advantage of it. However, as an introduction to the framework this was an interesting project for me to see how quickly pages can be put together when building upon work that's already been done.
