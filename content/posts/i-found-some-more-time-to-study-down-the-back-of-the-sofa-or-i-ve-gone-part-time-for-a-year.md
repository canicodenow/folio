Can I code now? No. Of course not.

Well, I know some stuff but this answer will only be yes [when I'm employed as a coder](/about "About me"), remember? I'll keep asking as that's the whole reason I'm doing this. It's hard, but I'm feeling a bit more confident lately.

## So what's changed?

I said before how hard I found it to study with full-time work. I think I may have solved that one. Although the solution has been taking a hefty pay cut - I mean _investing in my future_ by buying more time. Yeah that's better. As of this month, I've gone part-time at work to get more study time.

I've also lowered my expectations for how fast I can work through the content. I feel no shame - alright, I feel a modicum of shame - to admit things don't stick as quickly as I'd hoped. As such, after studying a topic I've taken to looking up supplementary sources for what I'm learning to really understand. This will do me good in the long-run. Yes it will.

## I've decided to immerse myself in coding content and attack it from all angles. This means:

1. The Odin Project as base, to have projects to work on
2. Video tutorials to supplement a topic
3. Books - I want to spend time reading about topics I've covered to get a more rounded understanding. At the moment, this has been Eloquent javaScript
4. Audiobooks - this is more for theory and "thinking like a coder", plus this means my drive to work can be useful as well
5. Medium/blogs/articles - specific topics I come across when researching e.g. recently [how to ask coding questions](https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603) and [how to solve programming problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
6. Utilising Notion to create a weekly plan and store notes, then Toggl to keep track of time (11 hours this past week, since you asked). I'll do a specific post about this, since I've put some work into it recently.

## What am I doing right now?

Creating a calculator for The Odin Project. As this uses HTML and CSS as well as javaScript, I'm using a tutorial to make a calculator using CSS Grid and tweaking it how I see fit. This is what I mean by supplementary sources. Read what those better than me do. Learn from them. At this point everyone is better than me, so it's easy to find such sources... This month I have also done:

##### **Arrays and methods**

* Wes Bos cardio workouts
* His Syntax podcast (yep, to supplement...)
* Watch and code's to-do list tutorial.
* The stuff I've listed above.

Updating this blog is part of my plan, so after a bit of time out I'll put in time weekly to update both my readers (optimistic) and keep myself in check. Until next time.
