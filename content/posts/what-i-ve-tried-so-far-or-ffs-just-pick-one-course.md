When I decided to learn to code I had no idea how many top quality resources were available – and for free, as well. I wanted to do them all – I _thought I could_ do them all. Even once I’d committed, I was still researching and finding others to do ‘next’. Because smashing through a course about learning to think like a programmer and learning an actual new language would be a breeze, wouldn’t it?

Then reality hit. I still would love to complete all the learning to code resources I’ve found, but there are a few things getting in the way:

* Time – I work 37.5 hours a week. A real pain, that.
* Sense – the logical thing to do is to fully understand one language, or one course, before trying to pick up others.
* Brain power – juggling numerous options and always looking ahead to the next one is just too much to think about.

So now I’m following The Odin Project through to completion. I think this is the best way to get myself ‘job-ready’.

## What have I tried before now?

The problem with having so many ways to learn to code and so much advice to be found is that it’s not easy to work out what’s _best_. When you find several great options, and then start one, you start to wonder if the grass is greener over on that one. Someone on Reddit said it was the best, so maybe I should do that instead.
